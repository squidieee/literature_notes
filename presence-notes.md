# VR System Fidelity

## Evaluating Display Fidelity and Interaction Fidelity in a Virtual Reality Game

Mcmahan 2012 - Bowman

They evaluate different display and interaction fidelity and their influences on performance, subjective judgments of presence, engagement, and usability. They found low display + low interaction and high display + high interaction work best than mix of how/high. They found that users had the greatest senses of presence, engagement, and usability with the high- display, high-interaction condition. 

Their questionnaires on presence, engagement, and usability seem to be good.

## Studying the Effects of Stereo , Head Tracking , and Field of Regard on a Small-Scale Spatial Judgment Task

Ragan 2013 - Bowman

They studies how stereo, head-tracking and For can affect task performance. They mentioned the CAVE display with stereo, head-tracking and high For as high fidelity display. Head-tracking is associated with interaction fidelity as it  "allows users to use natural, physical head and body movements to control motion parallax—a change in the visual location as a result of a change in the viewer’s location". The head-tracking conditions are divided as head-tracking + wand-control and wand-control only. They mentioned they evaluate it as a camera control method, rather than depth cue comparison. They found stereo+head-tracking significantly gave better performance. 

They use an interesting task with a cave-system structure which asked users to count connected tubes and detect the gap between a vertical tube and a horizontal level of tubes. They believed it is a high-precision spatial judgment task.

## Effects of VR system fidelity on analyzing isosurface visualization of volume datasets

Laha 2014 - Bowman

An extension of previous study on VR fidelity. They ran a controlled experiment evaluating the effects of three components of system fidelity (field of regard, stereoscopy, and head tracking) on a variety of abstract task categories that are applicable to various scientific domains, and also compared results with those from prior experiment using 3D texture-based rendering. They found: 

- for search and spatial judgment tasks with isosurface visualization, a stereoscopic display provides better performance, but for tasks with 3D texture-based rendering, displays with higher field of regard were more effective, independent of the levels of the other display components. 

- systems with high field of regard and head tracking improve performance in spatial judgment tasks. 

They have a good set of tasks for the Platynus dataset including: search, count, spatial judgment, pattern recognition etc. 

# Presence & Immersion

## Motion parallax from head movement enhances stereoscopic displays by improving presence and decreasing visual fatigue

Kongsilp 2017

Since one of the most important aspects of a FTVR system is how well it provides a sense of presence to users, they present a study that explores the role of motion parallax when combined with stereopsis in a FTVR system. They measured fatigue and **subjective perception of presence using standard questionnaires**. They found that users receiving both cues have lower visual fatigue and higher ratings for presence than those receiving stereo cues only.

## Embodiment and presence in virtual worlds: a review

Schulze 2010

A good survey paper that reviews previous presence studies. They defined six forms of presence as:

- telepresence
- social presence
- co-presence
- self-presence
- hyper presence
- eternal presence

They also discussed different theories of presence:

- Human response to sensory immersion
- Attention allocated to the virtual world
- Capacity for action
- Defining feature of the self

The first theory is particularly of interest as it defines presence with different aspects and discusses realism or sensory fidelity. It helps me to distinguish several concepts: perceptual fidelity, behavior fidelity and presence. See onenote for details.

## Virtual Reality : How Much Immersion Is Enough ?

Bowman 2007

A paper discusses how different technical factors of display can influence the feeling of immersion, including Fov, display size, resolution, frame rate etc.
