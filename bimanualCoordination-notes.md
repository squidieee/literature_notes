## Quantifying coordination in multiple DOF movement and its application to evaluating 6 DOF input devices
Zhai 1998

A good paper that evaluates the coordination of multiple DoF movement when conducting various 3D tasks. It explores how well user can control multiple DoF at the same time. The "wellness" is defined as the coordination of the motor performance. 

It investigates how to measure coordination for a given trial of motor performance as: 
- Simultaneity: Percentage duration of multiple DoF co-activated over the entire time of operation. But it does not account for the magnitude of the control actions in each DoF.

- Time-on-target and correlation:  Recording simultaneous time-on- target (STOT) in all pairs of degrees of freedom as well as all three at once, in addition to TOT (time-on-target) in each of the component dimensions. If the percent STOT was equal to the product of the component TOTs, then the components may be considered independent (uncoordinated). If greater, they were positively correlated (coordinated); if less, negatively correlated (discoordinated). However, both TOT and correlation as coordination measures have drawbacks. One of them is that these two measures do not account for perfect trials.

- Efficiency: It compares the "shortest" trajectory with actual trajectory for translation and likewise for rotation. Author suggested the coordination measure proposed in the paper can be applied to research beyond 6 DOF input devices such as coordination for two-hand computer input. 

Details of more measurement data using correlation and TOT can be found in following paper:

In this experiment, author used the effciency measurement rather than STOT and correlation. They claimed although effciency measure was sensitive enough to reveal performance differences, this is not necessary the only “correct” measure to quantify coordination in multiple DoF tasks.
