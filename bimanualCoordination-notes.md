## Quantifying coordination in multiple DOF movement and its application to evaluating 6 DOF input devices

Zhai 1998

A good paper that evaluates the coordination of multiple DoF movement when conducting various 3D tasks. It explores how well user can control multiple DoF at the same time. The "wellness" is defined as the coordination of the motor performance. 

It first investigates how to measure coordination for a given trial of motor performance as 
- Simultaneity: Percentage duration of multiple DoF co-activated over the entire time of operation. But it does not account for the magnitude of the control actions in each DoF.
