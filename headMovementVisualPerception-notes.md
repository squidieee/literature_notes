## Reaching measures of monocular distance perception : Forward versus side-to-side head movements and haptic feedback

Wickelgren 2000

They investigated whether forward or side-to-side head movements yielded more accurate and precise monocular egocentric distance information in a **target reaching task**. They found the performance was both more accurate and more precise in the **forward head movement** condition than in the side-to-side head movement condition.

## VOLUNTARY HEAD MOVEMENT AND ALLOCENTRIC PERCEPTION OF SPACE

Wexler 2003

They investigated the visual perception of three-dimensional object motion during voluntary and involuntary head motion in human subjects. They found that observers are more likely to use an allocentric frame of reference when they are executing voluntary head movements than while they are undergoing similar involuntary displacements.

## Absolute distance perception during in-depth head movement : calibrating optic flow with extra-retinal information

Peh 2003

They compared the condition of self-motion (SM) versus object-motion (OM) using equivalent optic flow field. When the amplitude of head movement was relatively constant, subjects estimated absolute distance rather accurately in both the SM and OM conditions. However, when the amplitude changed on a trial-to-trial basis, subjects’ performance deteriorated only in the OM condition. 

## The task-dependent use of binocular disparity and motion parallax under natural viewing conditions

Bradshaw 2000

The experiments used three different tasks :a depth nulling task, a depth-matching task, and an absolute depth judgement (shape) task. Real world stimuli were viewed (i) monocularly with head movements, (ii) binocularly and static, or (iii) binocularly with head movements. No effect of viewing condition was found whereas there was a large effect of task.

## A user study comparing head-mounted and stationary displays

Pausch1993

They designed a simple study to discriminate between a head-tracked and non-head-tracked camera control searching task, a **generic searching task**: locating twenty targets in a synthetic room. The only difference between the two groups was whether the virtual camera was controlled by muscles in the head, or muscles in the hand. They found: 
- users performing task decrease task performance time by roughly half(42 percent reduction) when they change,from a stationary display to a head-mounted display. 
- A second result is that users who practice with the head- mounted display reduce task completion time by 23 percent in later trials with the stationary display, suggesting a transfer.

## Evaluating stereo and motion cues for visualizing information nets in three dimensions

Ware 1996

Two experiments show that motion cues combined with stereo viewing can substantially increase the size of the graph that can be perceived in a **path-tracing task**. 
The results from a first study show that head-coupled stereo viewing can increase the size of an abstract graph that can be understood by a factor of three; using stereo alone provided an increase by a factor of 1.6 and bead coupling alone produced an increase by a factor of 2.2. 
The second experiment examined a variety of motion cues provided by head-coupling, hand-guided motion and automatic rotation, respectively, both with and without stereo in each case. The results show that structured 3D motion and stereo viewing both help in understanding, but that the kind of motion is not particularly important; all improve performance, and all are more significant than stereo cues. 

## Visualizing the Structure of Virtual Objects Using Head Tracked Stereoscopic Displays

Barfield 1997

"This study investigated the effects of stereopsis and head tracking on presence and performance in a desktop virtual environment. The subjects viewed the virtual image of a bent wire and were required to select the correct representation of the virtual wire from one of three drawings presented on paper. The results indicated that neither stereopsis nor head tracking improved the accuracy of selecting. The head tracking significantly improved the reported level of presence."

They hypothesized that structures may have been too simple for viewers to benefit from the additional spatial cues. 

## Motion parallax from head movement enhances stereoscopic displays by improving presence and decreasing visual fatigue

Kongsilp 2017

Since one of the most important aspects of a FTVR system is how well it provides a sense of presence to users, they present a study that explores the role of motion parallax when combined with stereopsis in a FTVR system. They measured fatigue and **subjective perception of presence using standard questionnaires**. They found that users receiving both cues have lower visual fatigue and higher ratings for presence than those receiving stereo cues only.

The interesting part is that the performance data is not better with head-movement. The amount of head-movement is even less in the condition with head-coupling. They explained that this could due to the concern of moving out of the tracking volume. 

## The importance of stereo and eye coupled perspective for eye-hand coordination in fish tank VR

Ware 2004

A Fitts’ Law tapping task was used to investigate the relative importance of stereo and head tracking in visually guided hand movements. The results show that stereo is considerably more important than eye-coupled perspective for this task, and that the benefits increase as task difficulty increases. 

A virtual barrier was introduced into the workspace above the targets and to one side. This forced the subject to lean to the right or the left to look around the barrier.

They found that head tracking had a measurable effect on performance, whereas others (Lion, 1993; Boritz & Booth, 1997) found no effect. The most likely reason for this is that they created a task for which head movements were required, whereas others did not. In some virtual reality tasks, looking around obstacles would be a normal part of interaction. In others it is likely to occur infrequently. Hence the value of this observation would also depend on the task mix.

They claims that the reason for them to find significant difference on head-tracking is because their task has occlusion and hence requires head-movement. This is probably correct but not the only reason. Their experiment setup directly measures the effect of correct perspective projection, rather than the effect of head-coupling. (The head-coupling provides correct perspective, motion parallax cue and proprioception cue. )



## 3D contour perception for flow visualization

Ware 2006

They carried out a study to evaluate the importance of 3D cues in perceiving the orientation of curved contours.
The result showed that stereo and motion cues are essential to perceiving the orientation of 3D lines.
If, however, the contours are rendered as shaded tubes, good orientation information is available even without stereo or motion depth cues.



## Effects of head tracking and stereo on non-isomorphic 3D rotation

LaViola 2008

They present an experimental study that explores how head tracking and stereo affect user performance when rotating 3D virtual objects using isomorphic and non-isomorphic rotation techniques. Subjects performed the rotation task with significantly less error with head tracking/stereo and no head tracking/stereo than with no head tracking/no stereo, regardless of rotation technique. 

 For task completion time, subjects completed the rotation task significantly faster under the no head tracking/stereo mode (4.25 seconds) than with the head tracking/stereo mode (4.6 seconds). For error rate, there is no significance in stereo only vs stereo head.  

Note that with head-tracking it is even slower to perform the rotation.



## pCubee: A Perspective-Corrected Handheld Cubic Display

Stavness 2010

"We evaluated our prototype as a visualization tool and as an input device by comparing it with a conventional LCD display and mouse for a 3D tree-tracing task. We found that bimanual interaction with pCubee and a mouse offered the best performance and was most preferred by users. "

Their experiment setup evaluates different rotation methods, rather than the effect of head-coupling. In each case related to pCubee, the head-coupling is available. The difference is the input control method from the hands. The comparison is between a direct rotation method with gestures and an indirect approach with mouse. The CD ratio probably plays an important role.
