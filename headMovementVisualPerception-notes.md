## Reaching measures of monocular distance perception : Forward versus side-to-side head movements and haptic feedback

Wickelgren 2000

They investigated whether forward or side-to-side head movements yielded more accurate and precise monocular egocentric distance information in a **target reaching task**. They found the performance was both more accurate and more precise in the **forward head movement** condition than in the side-to-side head movement condition.

## VOLUNTARY HEAD MOVEMENT AND ALLOCENTRIC PERCEPTION OF SPACE

Wexler 2003

They investigated the visual perception of three-dimensional object motion during voluntary and involuntary head motion in human subjects. They found that observers are more likely to use an allocentric frame of reference when they are executing voluntary head movements than while they are undergoing similar involuntary displacements.

## Absolute distance perception during in-depth head movement : calibrating optic flow with extra-retinal information

Peh 2003

They compared the condition of self-motion (SM) versus object-motion (OM) using equivalent optic flow field. When the amplitude of head movement was relatively constant, subjects estimated absolute distance rather accurately in both the SM and OM conditions. However, when the amplitude changed on a trial-to-trial basis, subjectsâ€™ performance deteriorated only in the OM condition. 

## The task-dependent use of binocular disparity and motion parallax under natural viewing conditions

Bradshaw 2000

The experiments used three different tasks :a depth nulling task, a depth-matching task, and an absolute depth judgement (shape) task. Real world stimuli were viewed (i) monocularly with head movements, (ii) binocularly and static, or (iii) binocularly with head movements. No effect of viewing condition was found whereas there was a large effect of task.

## A user study comparing head-mounted and stationary displays

Pausch1993

They designed a simple study to discriminate between a head-tracked and non-head-tracked camera control searching task, a **generic searching task**: locating twenty targets in a synthetic room. The only difference between the two groups was whether the virtual camera was controlled by muscles in the head, or muscles in the hand. They found: 
- users performing task decrease task performance time by roughly half(42 percent reduction) when they change,from a stationary display to a head-mounted display. 
- A second result is that users who practice with the head- mounted display reduce task completion time by 23 percent in later trials with the stationary display, suggesting a transfer.

## Evaluating stereo and motion cues for visualizing information nets in three dimensions

Ware 1996

Two experiments show that motion cues combined with stereo viewing can substantially increase the size of tbe graph that can be perceived in a **path-tracing task**. 
The results from a first study show that head-coupled stereo viewing can increase the size of an abstract graph that can be understood by a factor of three; using stereo alone provided an increase by a factor of 1.6 and bead coupling alone produced an increase by a factor of 2.2. 
The second experiment examined a variety of motion cues provided by head-coupling, hand-guided motion and automatic rotation, respectively, both with and without stereo in each case. The results show that structured 3D motion and stereo viewing both help in understanding, but that the kind of motion is not particularly important; all improve performance, and all are more significant than stereo cues. 

## Motion parallax from head movement enhances stereoscopic displays by improving presence and decreasing visual fatigue

Kongsilp 2017

Since one of the most important aspects of a FTVR system is how well it provides a sense of presence to users, they present a study that explores the role of motion parallax when combined with stereopsis in a FTVR system. They measured fatigue and **subjective perception of presence using standard questionnaires**. They found that users receiving both cues have lower visual fatigue and higher ratings for presence than those receiving stereo cues only.
