## Reaching measures of monocular distance perception : Forward versus side-to-side head movements and haptic feedback

Wickelgren 2000

They investigated whether forward or side-to-side head movements yielded more accurate and precise monocular egocentric distance information in a **target reaching task**. They found the performance was both more accurate and more precise in the **forward head movement** condition than in the side-to-side head movement condition.

## VOLUNTARY HEAD MOVEMENT AND ALLOCENTRIC PERCEPTION OF SPACE

Wexler 2003

They investigated the visual perception of three-dimensional object motion during voluntary and involuntary head motion in human subjects. They found that observers are more likely to use an allocentric frame of reference when they are executing voluntary head movements than while they are undergoing similar involuntary displacements.
