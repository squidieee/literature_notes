# Exploration and Virtual Camera Control in Virtual Three Dimensional Environments

1990 Colin Ware

This paper discusses and evaluates three different metaphors for virtual camera controls in VEs: 

- eyeball in hand 
- scene in hand: good for cloesd objects; not good for moving through an interior
- flying vehicle control: best for navigating through through an interior; poor for moving around a closed object

Evaluations are carried based on three "toy environments": SIGNS, MAZE and CUBE.

*Useful discussions on how 3D UI metaphors help the interaction process in relation to different tasks.*
*Evaluation tasks are interesting.*

# Did “Minority Report” Get It Wrong? Superiority of the Mouse over 3D Input Devices in a 3D Placement Task

2009 François Bérard 

This paper compares the performance effeciency in accomplishing 3D placement task using both 2D mouse and 3 DoF input devices. The 2D mouse outperformed the 3D input device. 

*Useful discussion on the mouse preference problem in 3D interaction.*
*List past literature that found 3D inputs outperformed 2D mouse.*

# A Survey of Design Issues in Spatial Input

1994 Ken Hinckley

This is a powerful survey paper that reviews almost all 3D interactions before 1994. It groups observations into two categories as human perception-based design and ergonomic-based design issues. 

From the perceptual standpoint, this paper suggests a set of strategies to help user s to better perceive a 3D VE based on previous literature. They suggested a distinction between *understanding* 3D vs. *experiencing* 3D: people are good at experiencing 3D but do not innattely understand 3D. They argue that performing 3D tasks is general, is a result of sub-conscious perception of 3D space. This is a process that has not been understood well. Previous paper demonstrated a number of issues that they found in user study to facilitate 3D space perception, including:

- Spatial references
- Relative gestures vs. absolute gesture
- Bimanual interaction
- Multi-sensory feedback
- Physical constraints
- Headtracking
- Reduce DoF
- Control metaphor (see 1990 Colin Ware)

Ergonomics issues includes:
- Integrate multi-DoF rapid coarse manipulation with slower but more precise manipulation techniques.
- Integrate 2D interaction with 3D interaction in a unified framework: hybrid interface.
- Allow users to adjust postures when interacting with 3D objects: recalibration mechanism is one way to alleviate the fatigue.
