- User Study: Evaluation of spatial reasoning with 3DPS

  - Mental Rotation Task
  - Experimental Setup
    - hardware: a spherical screen/planar screen + three projectors + camera + IR source
    - software: unity based texture rendering
  - Experimental Design
      1. Viewing Conditions: 3DPS+Touch and 2D display+Touch
      2. Experimental Variables: 
         - Independent variables: viewing condition (2 levels) and rotation angle (3 levels)
         - Dependent variables: error rate and completion time
      3. Possible extraneous factors: 
      	resolution, latency (we need a way to improve and test the latency), lighting, order of task, registraion error, tracking error (magnetic interference)
