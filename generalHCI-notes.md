# User studies and Usability Evaluations: From Research to Products

I. Scott Kackenzie 2015

- Three definition of research:
  - careful search
  - collecting information about a particular subject
  - push the frontier in light of new facts
- Three categories of research methods:
  - Observations study: 
    - Qualitative, rather than quantitative
    - Focus on *why or how*, as opposed to *what, where or when*
    - Goal is to understand human thoughts, feelings, attitude, emotion, passion, sensation, reflection, expression, mood, outlook, opinion, manner, style, approach, strategy...
    - Methods include: field study, expert reviews, contextual inquiries, interviews, case studies, focus groups, think aloud protocols, walkthroughs...
    - Studied in a natural setting, as opposed to constrained and artificial setting
    - **Usability Evaluation** is an example of observational method.
  - Experimental method:
    - Include independent and dependent variables
    - Controlled methodology brings prevision
    - **User Study** is an experiment with human subjects.
  - Correlational research:
    - Looking for relationships between variables
    - Quantitative
    - Provide a balance between relevance and precision
- Internal Validity & External Validity:
  - Interval validity: outcomes observed in the study really exist
  - External validity: outcomes observed are broadly applicable to other people
  - **User Study** focuses on Internal validity while **Usability Evaluation** focuses on External validity
- Difference between **User Study** and **Usability Evaluation**
  - User Study is performed early after research but before engineering and design; Usability evaluation is performed late (on a prototype) after engineering and design but before product release.
  - User Study is controlled with independent variables; Usability Evaluation is observational without a particular independent variable.
  - User Study has low-level details. The task is constrained to avoid extraneous influences and to provide capability to distinguish the levels of independent variables. Usability Evaluation is high-level. The task is natural and unconstrained. The goal is to reflect how end-user interacts with the UI and uncover potential problems.
