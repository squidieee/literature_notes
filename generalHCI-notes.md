# Chunking and Phrasing and the design of human-computer dialogues

William Buxton 1986

 This paper talks about how to design user interface pragmatics so that we can accelerate the process whereby novices begin to perform like experts. Experts and novices differ in the coarseness of granularity with which they view the constituent elements of a particular problem or task. Novices are attentive to low-level details. With experts, these low-level details can be performed automatically.

- One major problem is the cognitive load imposed by remembering the tokens and their orders of a command. The approach is to limit the number of arguments to a command. (eg: 1-step move vs. 2-step copy n' paste)
- When compound task is necessary, breaks it into sub-tasks. Sub-tasks require the "glue" to tie them together. (eg: select from a pop-up menu = invoke the menu + navigate to select + select, the tension of the finger holding down the button is the "glue" which provides constant feedback that we are in a temporary state.)

# User studies and Usability Evaluations: From Research to Products

I. Scott Kackenzie 2015

- Three definition of research:
  - careful search
  - collecting information about a particular subject
  - push the frontier in light of new facts
- Three categories of research methods:
  - Observations study: 
    - Qualitative, rather than quantitative
    - Focus on *why or how*, as opposed to *what, where or when*
    - Goal is to understand human thoughts, feelings, attitude, emotion, passion, sensation, reflection, expression, mood, outlook, opinion, manner, style, approach, strategy...
    - Methods include: field study, expert reviews, contextual inquiries, interviews, case studies, focus groups, think aloud protocols, walkthroughs...
    - Studied in a natural setting, as opposed to constrained and artificial setting
    - **Usability Evaluation** is an example of observational method.
  - Experimental method:
    - Include independent and dependent variables
    - Controlled methodology brings prevision
    - **User Study** is an experiment with human subjects.
  - Correlational research:
    - Looking for relationships between variables
    - Quantitative
    - Provide a balance between relevance and precision
- Internal Validity & External Validity:
  - Interval validity: outcomes observed in the study really exist
  - External validity: outcomes observed are broadly applicable to other people
  - **User Study** focuses on Internal validity while **Usability Evaluation** focuses on External validity
- Difference between **User Study** and **Usability Evaluation**
  - User Study is performed early after research but before engineering and design; Usability evaluation is performed late (on a prototype) after engineering and design but before product release.
  - User Study is controlled with independent variables; Usability Evaluation is observational without a particular independent variable.
  - User Study has low-level details. The task is constrained to avoid extraneous influences and to provide capability to distinguish the levels of independent variables. Usability Evaluation is high-level. The task is natural and unconstrained. The goal is to reflect how end-user interacts with the UI and uncover potential problems.
