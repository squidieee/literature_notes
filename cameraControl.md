# Exploration and Virtual Camera Control in Virtual Three Dimensional Environments

1990 Colin Ware

This paper discusses and evaluates three different metaphors for virtual camera controls in VEs: 

- eyeball in hand 
- scene in hand: good for closed objects; not good for moving through an interior
- flying vehicle control: best for navigating through through an interior; poor for moving around a closed object

Evaluations are carried based on three "toy environments": SIGNS, MAZE and CUBE.

*Useful discussions on how 3D UI metaphors help the interaction process in relation to different tasks.*

*Evaluation tasks are interesting.*


# The Object Inside: Assessing 3D Examination with a Spherical Handheld Perspective-Corrected Display

Berard 2017

This paper conducts a user study using a graph tracing task ( or object examination task as they named it). This study compared the task performance of a handheld spherical FTVR, an traditional screen and physical counterparts. They found the digital interfaces are more efficient than the physical shape. The traditional 2D interface with touchpad outperforms spherical FTVR.

*The physical object is in cube shape that has seams. It may not be fair to compare it with spherical display and traditional 2d display. Also it has limitations on the nature lighting: not enough contrast between object and background; specular reflection from the box; etc.*

# 3D Contour Perception for Flow Visualization

Colin Ware 2006

This paper investigates the Rendering issues and Perception issues when visualizing with trajectory-based data. [Rendering] They found that when contours are rendered as shaded tubes, users can perform accurate judgments. [Perception] This combined with stereoscopic and kinetic depth cues results in most consistently good judgment.

*Use the rendering suggestions in the user study.*



# Perceiving real-world viewpoint changes
Daniel Simons 1998
(Psychology study)
A research report on the distinction between object rotations and viewpoint motions. Both object rotations and viewpoint motions generate the same retina image, but this report focuses on distinguishing the mechanisms of object rotations and viewpoint motions. Viewpoint motions potentially provide more information than object orientations, including but not limited to the spatial reference (visual information), vestibular and proprioceptive information. But they did not compare the task performances of object orientation and viewpoint movement conditions. Instead, they compared the effect of changing retina projections in the condition of rotation and movements. They found even when orientation changes and viewpoint changes produced the same changes to the retinal projection, accuracy was disrupted only in the orientation condition, not in the movement condition.

# Eye-hand co-ordination with force feedback
Colin Ware 2000

An emprical study that investigates the importance of head coupling and force feedback in conducting Fitts Law Tapping Task. Both of the head-coupling and force feedback have been found to imporve tapping performance by 20%. So skilled designers can take advantage of these tools and improve their working efficiency. 
Tapping Task has been modified by introducing a "barrier" which forces changes of the head position by leaning to the left/right. 
Eye-hand coordination is introduced as hand movement controlled with visual feedback and reinforced by hand contact with objects. 

# The importance of stereo and eye coupled perspective for eye-hand coordination in fish tank VR
Colin Ware 2004

An emprical study that investigates the importance of visual cues in conducting Fitts Law Tapping Task. Stereopsis is found to be more important than motion parallax. 
Tapping Task has been modified by introducing a "barrier" which forces changes of the head position by leaning to the left/right. 
Stereopsis is expected to be more important in eye-hand coordination based on previous studies and observations (threading a needle requires steady hands without parallax information).

# The roles of vision and eye movements in the control of activities of daily living
Michael Land 1999
(Psychology study)
An experiment that determines the pattern of eye fixations in a tea-making task in a natural setting. There are four functions of gaze fixation in manipulation task: 

- locating objects
- directing the hand/object in hand to contact another object
- guiding contact between two objects that are approaching one another
- checking the state of task-related variables
