# Annexing Reality: Enabling Opportunistic Use of Everyday Objects as Tangible Proxies in Augmented Reality

Anuruddha Hettiarachchi 2016

Provide passive haptics by augmenting user's surrounding physical objects. 
When augmenting, They try to render overlay by minimize the mismatch between the virtual and real object. 
They tracked object, not the hand. They have a voting system to decide the matching between tracked object and virtual object.
The main use case that they focus on is to help AR content developer to create AR content using their system.
