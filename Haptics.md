# Passive Haptics

## Tangible Bits: Towards Seamless Interfaces between People, Bits and Atoms

Hiroshi Ishii and Brygg Ullmer 1997

Tangible Bits allows users to "grasp & manipulate" bits in the center of users’ attention by coupling the bits with everyday physical objects and architectural surfaces.

## Substitutional Reality: Using the Physical Environment to Design Virtual Reality Experiences

Simeone 2015

This paper presented findings on defining the mismatch between physical and virtual objects based on the passive haptics. They provided a layered model of modification in which at each level the virtual element gets further away from its physical counterpart as Replica, Aesthetic, Addition/Subtraction, Function and Category. They conducted two user studies to evaluate the mismatch caused by the modification of: 1) virtual models given the same physical counterpart, and 2) physical models given the same virtual counterpart. The result of their studies helped to define to what extent we could modify the appearance/property of the virtual rendering before the mismatch is "too strong". 

## Annexing Reality: Enabling Opportunistic Use of Everyday Objects as Tangible Proxies in Augmented Reality

Daniel Wigdor 2016

This paper proposed a system that opportunistically finds physical objects from the user’s surrounding that would best represent a given set of virtual objects. The idea is to provide passive haptics using everyday ojects. They constantly scan user's surrounding physical objects and then tailors the virtual objects to match the shape and size of the annexed physical ones. They proposed an algorithm to recognize and match physical objects with virtual objects by minimizing the mismatch of shapes. They tracked object, not the hand. They have a voting system to decide the matching between tracked object and virtual object.

For evaluation, they did not evaluate their matching algorithm in several real-world settings with different physical objects, but rather conducted a developer-center study to assess the utility and usability of the system and interface for developers.

Their system includes a step-by-step procedure to characterize the matching algorithm. They want to know whether these steps make sense for developers (such as AR content creater) who may use their system. So the study focues on whether developers could understand these steps and epxress their design intent etc. They found content creators accepted the Annexing Reality system as a useful tool for designing augmented reality applications in which virtual objects are opportunistically paired to and controlled by everyday physical objects.
