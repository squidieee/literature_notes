# Perceiving absolute scale in virtual environments: How theory and application have mutually informed the role of body-based perception

Stefanucci 2015

A Chapter of a book which surveys size perception studies.

The chapter first surveyed previous research on absolute distance study. The depth perception has also been mentioned as "egocentric distance", which measures the distance between the object and viewer, also called "absolute spatial information".

Most of previous study on the egocentric distance (depth), while there were few work on the "exocentric distance", which is the distance between two objects, neither of them being the viewer. This is "relative spatial information".

Different depth cues have different contributions on the absolute and relative spatial information. For example, binocular convergence, accommodation, linear perspective and familiar size are believed to contribute on the absolute spatial perception with limited range, usually within the personal space, which extends a bit beyond the distance that one can reach. 
Besides personal space, there are also action space and vista space. Action space extends from the far boundary of personal space to about 30m. Vista space is everything beyond action space. 

While there are extensive work on egocentric distance perception in VE, there is relative limited work on absolute size perception in VE, in comparison to real-word size estimates. 

The author categorizes size perception studies as 1. conscious awareness-based task; 2. action-based task; 3. affordance-based task;

- Awareness-based task: measure the conscious awareness that an observer has of his surrounding space. Eg:     rate the size/depth
- Action-based task: have people perform actions based on visual information about locations in the environment. Action-based measures of perceptual accuracy have been criticized because they also may be subject to biases and because it is difficult to disentangle inaccuracies in perception from inaccuracies in action.
- Affordance-based task: have people to make affordance judgments which relate environmental properties to an observerâ€™s actions. Eg: whether they can pass through an aperture hole with the body or wear a ring on their finger given different ring sizes. This is an evaluation methodology introduced by the author's group. They found it effective using grasping and reaching affordance judgement tasks.

The author's group worked on this topic and found perceived object appeared to be smaller in VE compared to real-world, which can be alleviated by increasing the complexity of context and adding stereo. They then further investigated the effectiveness of displaying virtual self-avatar and virtual hand to improve the size perception in VE. They found the perceived size can be influenced by the shape and size of virtual hand.

# The effects of scene complexity, stereovision, and motion parallax on size constancy in a virtual environment

Luo2007

Subjects adjusted the size of a virtual bottle at different depth based on a real bottle. Independent variables are context-based depth cues (a table with size familiar to real object rendered in the scene), stereoscopsis and motion parallax. Only motion parallax is found to be non-significant to the user performance. 

# Size-Constancy in the CAVE

Kenyon2007

Size constancy is the phenomenon where an object is perceived as being the same size regardless of the distance from the observer, even if the size of retinal projection shrinks with increasing distance from the observer. Previous studies showed in *real environment* the performance suffers when the number of depth cues is reduced. Subjects adopt a size judgement approach based on the size of retinal projection. That is, instead of perceiving a constant size when changing the viewing distance, the object size appeared to shrink with increasing distance from the observer. Previous studies in the *virtual environment* show no size-constancy. But author thinks this is due to lack of depth cues as the previous work used sparse environment that eliminated surrounding objects which provide cues to the depth.

The paper tried to understand to what extent size-constancy could be experienced in this VE using CAVE. Subjects were tested using a rich environment with a number of surrounding items in the environment accompanied the virtual object, and a sparse environment where no surrounding items were provided and only the virtual object (a coke bottle) was visible. 

Subjects were instructed to adjust the size of bottle based on the size of a real bottle using a wand. They analyzed the ratio between the estimated size and actual size. They found size-constancy was more prevalent when the environment contained objects surrounding the test object in the scene to aid depth perception. Without these surrounding objects,most of the subjects adopted a visual angle (VA) performance when sizing the bottle.

# Evaluating the accuracy of size perception in real and virtual environments

Stefanucci2012

Affordance judgments measure perceived size by assessing what users believe they can or cannot do with objects in virtual environments. They used two affordance judgement tasks for grasping and reaching objects, in two viewing conditions (one real scene with a frame, the other with a fixed viewpoint perspective-corrected screen). For both judgment tasks,they found that users underestimated the size of the objects when judging their action capabilities for the desktop virtual environment in comparison to a real environment.

# Evaluating the accuracy of size perception on screen-based displays: Displayed objects appear smaller than real objects

Stefanucci2015

Same study as above but with stereo: stereo can reduce the effect of smaller real objects.
