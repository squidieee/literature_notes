# Perceiving absolute scale in virtual environments: How theory and application have mutually informed the role of body-based perception

Stefanucci 2015

A Chapter of a book which surveys size perception studies.

The chapter first surveyed previous research on absolute distance study. The depth perception has also been mentioned as "egocentric distance", which measures the distance between the object and viewer, also called "absolute spatial information".

Most of previous study on the egocentric distance (depth), while there were few work on the "exocentric distance", which is the distance between two objects, neither of them being the viewer. This is "relative spatial information".

Different depth cues have different contributions on the absolute and relative spatial information. For example, binocular convergence, accommodation, linear perspective and familiar size are believed to contribute on the absolute spatial perception with limited range, usually within the personal space, which extends a bit beyond the distance that one can reach. 
Besides personal space, there are also action space and vista space. Action space extends from the far boundary of personal space to about 30m. Vista space is everything beyond action space. 

While there are extensive work on egocentric distance perception in VE, there is relative limited work on absolute size perception in VE, in comparison to real-word size estimates. 

The author categorizes size perception studies as 1. conscious awareness-based task; 2. action-based task; 3. affordance-based task;

- Awareness-based task: measure the conscious awareness that an observer has of his surrounding space. Eg:     rate the size/depth
- Action-based task: have people perform actions based on visual information about locations in the environment. Action-based measures of perceptual accuracy have been criticized because they also may be subject to biases and because it is difficult to disentangle inaccuracies in perception from inaccuracies in action.
- Affordance-based task: have people to make affordance judgments which relate environmental properties to an observerâ€™s actions. Eg: whether they can pass through an aperture hole with the body or wear a ring on their finger given different ring sizes. This is an evaluation methodology introduced by the author's group. They found it effective using grasping and reaching affordance judgement tasks.

The author's group worked on this topic and found perceived object appeared to be smaller in VE compared to real-world, which can be alleviated by increasing the complexity of context and adding stereo. They then further investigated the effectiveness of displaying virtual self-avatar and virtual hand to improve the size perception in VE. They found the perceived size can be influenced by the shape and size of virtual hand.

# The effects of scene complexity, stereovision, and motion parallax on size constancy in a virtual environment

Luo2007

Subjects adjusted the size of a virtual bottle at different depth based on a real bottle. Independent variables are context-based depth cues (a table with size familiar to real object rendered in the scene), stereoscopsis and motion parallax. Only motion parallax is found to be non-significant to the user performance.
